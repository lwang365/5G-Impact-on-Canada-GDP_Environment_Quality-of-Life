# 5G-Impact-on-Canada-GDP_Environment_Quality-of-Life
We examined the effects of 5G technology on the GDP, environment, and quality of life in this research paper. We reviewed many of the existing literature reviews done by various renowned organizations, alliances and authors on the subject and then based on the information at hand tried to analyze it. Our study will shed light on the potential advantages of 5G technology and give suggestions for policymakers and industry stakeholders. We started by looking at how 5G will affect GDP. We looked into how 5G technology is promoting development across a range of sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, rural area and agriculture. We also examined how 5G affected the job market and how Canadian economic growth is related to investment in 5G technology. Second, we looked into how 5G will affect the ecosystem and looked at how much more energy-efficient 5G networks are than earlier wireless technology generations and investigate how 5G might help the creation of smart communities and environmentally friendly systems that are good for the environment. Finally, we examined how 5G will affect peopleâ€™s quality of life. We found how 5G is facilitating new entertainment and social engagement opportunities, enhancing access to healthcare and education.
We also utilize the UK data about the 5G wireless use of different categories to predict the trend of 5G network development.
